# DataTools
## Version 5.0

**September 5, 2021**

So, I've finally started programming regularly in WinUI 3/Project Reunion and by extension the UWP namespaces.  I will be cleaning this code up and organizing it into sections based on target type.  I will also be cleaning up and 'universalizing' all of the universal code and the Win32 code will become better organized. I'm going to merge code from separate DLL's and break out new ones.  

The organizational structure of this project is going to be changed so much that the changes will be breaking.  

Therefore, I am going to be starting work on **DataTools 7.0** which will be a major reorganization (but not an entire rewrite).  

Please, if you have questions or comments, do not hesitate to use the issues board to comment or just reach out.

DataTools Memory, Hardware, and misc. Libraries v5.0

Completely refactored into C# and .NET 5.0.

Introducing a portable version of DataTools core library (not complete.)

This entire solution is a large, slow, work in progress that has taken years. 
Most of the code is well-documented.

This package is a new project, completely separate from the Visual Basic projects, and are only similar on the surface.  Most of the changes are breaking.  

More documentation will be forthcoming in the next few weeks (as of 11/28/2020), as I get the internal documentation organized.

The Demo Project is the **SysInfoTool** project.
