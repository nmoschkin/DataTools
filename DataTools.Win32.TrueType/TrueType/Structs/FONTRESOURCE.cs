        // each entry Is the character width. The second WORD of
        // each entry Is the byte offset from the beginning of the
        // FONTINFO Structure to the character bitmap. For Windows
        // 3.0, the second And third WORDs are used for the
        // offset.

        // There Is one extra entry at the end of this table that
        // describes an absolute-space character. This entry
        // corresponds to a character that Is guaranteed to be
        // blank; this character Is Not part of the normal
        // character set.

        // The number Of entries In the table Is calculated As
        // ((dfLastChar - dfFirstChar) + 2). This includes a
        // spare, the sentinel offset mentioned in the following
        // paragraph.

        // to be used for a particular character Is calculated by
        // subtracting its entry from the Next one, so that there
        // Is a sentinel at the end of the array of values.

        // For proportionally spaced vector fonts, each 4-byte
        // entry Is divided into two 2-byte fields. The first
        // field gives the starting offset from the start Of the
        // bitmap of the character strokes. The second field gives
        // the pixel width Of the character.

        // <facename> An ASCII character String specifying the name Of the
        // font face. The size Of this field Is the length Of the
        // String plus a NULL terminator.

        // <devicename> An ASCII character String specifying the name Of the
        // device if this font file Is for a specific device. The
        // size of this field Is the length of the string plus a
        // NULL terminator.

        // <bitmaps> This field contains the character bitmap definitions.
        // Each character Is stored as a contiguous set of bytes.
        // (In the old font format, this was Not the case.)

        // The first Byte contains the first 8 bits Of the first
        // scanline (that Is, the top line of the character). The
        // second byte contains the first 8 bits of the second
        // scanline. This continues until a first "column" Is
        // completely defined.

        // The following Byte contains the Next 8 bits Of the
        // first scanline, padded With zeros On the right If
        // necessary (And so on, down through the second
        // "column"). If the glyph Is quite narrow, each scanline
        // Is covered by 1 byte, with bits set to zero as
        // necessary for padding. If the glyph Is very wide, a
        // third Or even fourth set of bytes can be present.

        // NOTE: The character bitmaps must be stored
        // contiguously And arranged in ascending order.
